# QuoteIT Mobile Application

### Purpose of the App:
 
 Most of the time is spent finding the best prices from suppliers. To make it easier for a company to send their requirements and get the prices from multiple vendors, we have created a portal. When a client raises a request for a good, a vendor gets a WhatsApp notification. The link on the WhatsApp notification asks the Vendor to Sign in and see the Requirement Document and Post a quote. We have allowed the Client to Create the document and assign fields for Name & Quantity which the vendor can fill. The client can see all the vendor bids easily and select one of them.

### Functionalities Included:
     1.Login and SignUp with Authentication,where the user can select its Role.
     2.Role Selection i.e either "Client" or "Vendor" decides the interface of the App.
     3.E-Market space allows the Client to browse through various categories and narrow down to final choices.
     4.The Client finalises the choices and post request for Quotations, to which a whatsapp 
       notification(which includes link to QuoteIT's App or Web) is sent to all the Potential.
     5.The vendor receives the notification and the link will redirect the vendor to register on the QuoteIT's Platform.
     6.The Vendor uploads the quotation to the queries he approves.
